CRA

So if I remember correctly, the test is divided in 4 parts. 1st part is behavioral questions about how you are as an individual in a work setting, not sure if they grade that part. The remaining 3 parts are all timed. The next section is math. Third part is English, they give a scenario for you to read then ask questions. Last part (not sure what the name of it is) but it's matching numbers and letters.


In terms of phone interview questions

They asked about how well I worked in a team environment and give a specific example (they do tell you in the email you get that they will ask you this question).

As for the other ones they are situational based on a blurb and you have to extract information from it after they ask you questions.

Final question is role played based on how you would deal with a situation.



if they contacted your references, then you are good as accepted.
