Self hypnosis, You got this.
It's impossible, but that's what makes it a worth challenge.
Control your own mind.
Start slowly and consistently.
The more you fuck around, the more you going to find out.
Stay hard.
Just do it anyway.
You're the man!

Technologies to learn:
- Linux: navigate, create, mv, rm, authorization access on files/directories
- LAMP - a set of technologies used. A good goal to do and create. (Linux, Apache/Nginx [newer], MySQL, PHP/Python)
- Python
- Active Directory
- Database: mysql (more suited with web based like data transactions, postgresql (more on data analysis, data warehousing, or used on complex queries) (relational, object oriented, hierarchical, network)
- networking: fundamentals, routers, switched, cli, making scripts
- excel: basic navigation and helps with database with organzing datasets
- 

Projects:
- Price tracker (can also be done on raspberry pi) on products you like to get live price changes
- Stock tracker (can use selenium to control a headless browser with an API, also compatible with javascript)  


from job posts:
- Proficient in python with a focus on extracting information from HTML and other sources such as PDF – Selenium | Beautiful Soup | OCR (e.g., Textract, PDFMiner)
- Proficient with RDBMS and writing SQL queries – MySQL | PostgreSnQL |SQLAlchemy

Sublime Text packages:
- package control: to install and remove packages
- fileicon
- fontcycler
- webfont: fonts selection from fontstorage.com
	- intially install the font that's missing from the OS by downloading and opening the .ttf (truetype font file) and then installing it


Function vs Method
- A method is on an object or is static in class.
- A function is independent of any object (and outside of any class).
	- For Java and C#, there are only methods.
	- For C, there are only functions.
	- For C++ and Python it would depend on whether or not you're in a class.
	But in basic English:
		> Function: Standalone feature or functionality.
		> Method: One way of doing something, which has different approaches or methods, but related to the same aspect (aka class).

Nesting "if" statements is bad.
- might as well just create two functions

for loop:

if statements:

**keep in mind about the built-in python functions (ex. [extend()]) where you can use these functions instead of control flow statements like for loop, while loop, if/else statements, etc.
