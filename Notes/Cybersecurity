Terminologies and technology comparisons:

dedicated vs bare metal server > 

hsrp (hot standby routing protocol) and vrrp (virtual redundancy routing protocol) 
svi (switch virtual interface)

vrf (virtual routing and forwarding) - mostly used on mpls, can also create vpn tunnels for specific or solely dedicated to a single network or client/host.
    - allows for virtual creation of multiple routes instate/inside on one physical device
    - allows users to simultaneously manage multiple routing tables
    - can be used for MP BGP and MPLS deployments
    - multiple vpns for customers can use overlapping ip addresses without conflict
    - user may segement network paths without multiple routers, improving network functionality

mpls (multiprotocol label switching) > think of a toll gated road when compared to sd-wan
    -

sd-wan (sofware defined - wide area network) > think of using the normal/public roads [public infrastructure like WAN] when compared to mpls
    -

bgp (boder gateway protocol)
    - ibgp
    - ebgp
    - mp bgp

eigrp (enhanced interior gateway routing protocol) > proprietary to Cisco
    - igrp

ospf (open shortest path first)
    - ospfv3

is-is (intermediate system to intemediate system)
    - 

QoS (Quality of Service) > operates at layer 3
    - dscp
    - policing and shaping
    - sla
    - cos > operates at layer 2 which is 802.1Q vlan

voip (voice over internet protocol)
